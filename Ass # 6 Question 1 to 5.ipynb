    "Answer: Object Oriented Programming allows for simplified programming. It is a software programming model constructed around objects. It allows programmers to define the data type of a data structure and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure. The data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects. Its features include Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Inheritance. "
